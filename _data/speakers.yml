  bio: "Transitioning from astrophysics to bioinformatics in 2003, Alicia Oshlack joined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute's Bioinformatics Division. She later became Head of Bioinformatics at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute before her current role at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Alicia Oshlack's research focuses on developing computational and statistical methods for analyzing transcriptome data, including RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, to understand gene expression and its implications in human diseases. She currently serves as the Head of the Computational Biology Program and group leader at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. In 2021, she was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences."
